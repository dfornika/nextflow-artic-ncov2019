# Nextflow pipeline for ARTIC nCoV-2019 Analysis

This pipeline is based on the SOP described here:

https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html

This implementation of the pipeline has not been verified or endorsed by the ARTICnetwork.

For a more complete and robust implementation, please refer to the [nf-core-nanoporeamplicons](https://github.com/will-rowe/nf-core-nanoporeamplicons) pipeline, which is a work-in-progress but does have direct involvement from the ARTICnetwork team.

For information on setting up your analysis environment, see the [environment setup instructions](https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-it-setup.html) and the [artic-ncov2019](https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019) repository.
